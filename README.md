# SyncSrt
This App helps to change the **rate** of a ```srt file``` and you can download the first even-non-matching .srt for the movie and then with a little effort find out ```when I have heard what``` and this helps to find the rate of the srt file related to the movie file you have.

## technical points
The algorigthm is very easy. compare two times and find the rate (times are converted to milliseconds and then compared). and then convert all time-lines of the srt file into new ones
